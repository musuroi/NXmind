## 👋 Why NXmind?

As a person who loves jotting down ideas, I faced frustration with many mind mapping tools. They are powerful but overly complicated. Each time I wanted to organize a thought, I dealt with layers of menus, numerous format options, and endless templates. Even simple text changes needed multiple clicks.

I wanted a straightforward tool that let me focus on thinking itself. 

Thus, **NXmind** was born.

## 💡 How NXmind Works

NXmind is designed with simplicity in mind.

* **No Rich Text**: There’s no need to think about bold, italic, or font changes. Just text.
* **No Templates**: Start with a clean node and write instantly.
* **No Formatting**: Don’t waste time adjusting colors or borders. Logic is key in mind mapping.

### Simple Workflow
1. **Install & Open**: Instant access without delays.
2. **Input**: Keyboard shortcuts handle everything (`Tab` creates a sub-node, `Enter` adds a sibling node).
3. **Pin on Desktop**: Keep NXmind on your desktop like a sticky note.
4. **Summon Anytime**: Got an idea? Open NXmind, jot it down, and hide it again.

It should be as available as air—present when needed, gone when not.
